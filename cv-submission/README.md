As the final part of the CV module, we were required to submit our completed CV through a formal platform (e.g., Blackboard or submission portal).

Ensure my CV was submitted in the correct format, with a professional file name, and by the deadline.

**Action**:  
I followed all instructions from the module, renamed the file appropriately (`RanelaniEngel_CV.pdf`), and submitted it. I also captured a screenshot as proof of submission.

**Result**:  
The CV was successfully submitted. This experience helped me better understand how to professionally handle document preparation and digital submission processes — a vital skill for real-world job applications.
