The Workplace Etiquette module was designed to provide a clear framework for the professional behaviors expected in this corporate environment.

**🎯 Task:**
My objective was to master the rules of professional etiquette and seamlessly integrate them into my daily actions during my internship. The goal was not just to pass an assessment, but to build a reputation as a reliable, respectful, and collaborative team member who contributes positively to the workplace culture.

I actively studied the course material, paying close attention to the nuances of digital communication, conflict resolution, and ethical conduct. During my internship, I made a conscious effort to translate this knowledge into practice. For example, I consistently arrived 10-15 minutes early for meetings, managed sensitive information with discretion, and prioritized my work tasks over personal device use. I actively sought feedback from my supervisor on my professional conduct and made adjustments to ensure I was aligned with company expectations.
